    "   *What are the determinants of IPO underpricing phenomena?*\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "   When presented with this business question, our first task was to better understand the question at hand. We started by researching the IPO underpricing phenomena to familiarize ourselves with the business question and standard IPO terminology. Underpricing occurs when the price of an initial public offering (IPO) is lower than the price of the first trade.\n",
    "## Data Understanding   \n",
    "   Our next step was to study the data dictionary provided. What variables were we provided with to predict the determinants of underpricing? The dataset provided had 682 records, and 22 attributes. Variable data types included Continuous/Float, Binary/Boolean, and Text. We aimed to get a better understanding of the types of variables provided along with their definitions, not only to help us determine whether instances in our dataset seemed incorrect, but also so that we may come up with hypotheses of which variables we thought may make the best predictors. Once we gained a better idea of the data that was provided via the data dictionary and general research, we moved on to inspecting the actual dataset. We started this task by reading the data into python, previewing the loaded dataframe, inspecting the datatypes each variable mapped to, running descriptive statistics on the dataset, and finally creating histograms for each variable."
